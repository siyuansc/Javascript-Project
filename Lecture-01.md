# Course Overview

This course introduces tools and techniques for **building user interfaces** that are reactive and responsive. It covers a variety of design heuristics for creating interfaces that are usable and accessible. It also teaches software design patterns to implement user interfaces at scale.


---

# SI 379 Compared to Other Courses

- **SI 364 (Building Data-Driven Applications)**:
    - Little overlap
    - Much less focus on back-end, more focus on building front-end
- **SI 339 (Design of Complex Websites)**: 
    - Is complementary; about 2 weeks of overlap
    - Much less emphasis on HTML and CSS (some overlap)
    - Much more emphasis on JavaScript (some overlap)
- **EECS 493 (User Interface Development)**:
    - Assume less prior programming knowledge
    - Focus on JavaScript rather than framework

---

# Recommended Pairings

- SI 339 (Design of Complex Websites)
- More generally:
  - Consider taking **graphic design** courses
    - *Especially* if you are not "artsy"
  - Visualization-oriented courses
  - Product design and psychology courses
* Ability to prototype and build UIs is like a **super power**

<!-- Doing a puzzle hunt and one of the clueds was a secretly encoded crossword puzzle...friend whipped up a quick UI fo r solving it -->
<!-- Had an idea for how something could be displayed in a better way, and was able to prototype it in a few hours -->

* Overcome AI limitations
* Understand the fundamentals to better guide and evaluate AI-generated code
* Collaborate effectively with AI tools for better outcomes
* It can be fun! ...at times...
* *...([this list was partially generated by ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/677f5729-6394-800e-8fb7-bb1de547b2a6) ðŸ™ƒ)...*

- LLMs will fundamentally change programming
* Most programmers should work *with* LLMs

# We will learn...

- HTML (a little)
- CSS (a little)
- JavaScript

The *vast majority* of this class will focus on JavaScript. However, we need to first cover HTML and CSS.

---

# Why JavaScript?

- Versatile
- Ubiquitous
- Popular
- A good way of learning **event-driven** programming

# ...but we start with HTML

(and do as little of it as possible)

# Reading Paragraph

- When you open a website, what you're seeing is the result of three complementary technologies working together: HTML builds the structure, CSS styles it, and JavaScript makes it interactive. While our journey will eventually center on JavaScript, we need to start with the foundationâ€”HTMLâ€”to understand what we're making interactive in the first place.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) might seem simple, but it's the blueprint that browsers use to understand your content. Think of each HTML tag as giving special meaning to content: a paragraph tag tells the browser "this is a paragraph," while a heading tag signals "this is the main heading." These tags create a rich vocabulary: paragraphs, emphasis for italics, importance for bold text, and headings from major to minor levels.

What makes HTML powerful is how these elements nest together like a family tree. We create relationships: html is the root, body is its child, while headings and paragraphs are siblings that share the same parent. The strong element might be nested as a child of a paragraph, forming a structured hierarchy that browsers use to interpret the page.

HTML elements gain superpowers through attributesâ€”special modifiers in the opening tag. Links use href to specify destinations, images use src to find their pictures and alt to provide descriptions, and some attributes like disabled on buttons don't even need valuesâ€”their mere presence is enough to trigger behavior.

There are a few more HTML essentials to remember: tags aren't case-sensitive (though lowercase is conventional), empty elements can use self-closing syntax, comments hide content from display, and every HTML document should start with a DOCTYPE declaration to identify itself as HTML5.

While we'll move quickly to JavaScript, this HTML foundation gives us the structure we'll manipulate with JavaScript. We're learning just enough HTML to power what comes nextâ€”but that foundation is essential.

# HTML

- **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
- A markup language for describing the structure of a web page

![](images/hypertext.png)

---

# Elements in HTML

![](images/element_illustration.png)

- Tags are case-insensitive (`<xyz>` is the same as `<XYZ>` or `<XyZ>`)
    - ...but use lowercase
- If there is no content, we can use a "self-closing" tag: `<br />`


---

# Basic Element Types

- `<p />` specifies a paragraph of text.
- `<strong />` specifies important text, which is typically displayed as **bold** text.
- `<em />` specifies text that should be emphasized, which is typically *italicized*.
- `<h1 />` specifies a "first-level" heading (usually a title)
- `<h2 />` specifies a "second-level" heading
- ...`<h3 />` -- `<h6 />` specifies a "third-level" through "sixth-level" heading

---

# Nesting Elements

- Elements can be nested inside of each other
- For example, we can have a paragraph (`p`) with a **bolded** (`strong`) word:

```html
<p>
    This is a <strong>bolded</strong> word.
</p>
```

---

# Element Trees

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph with some <strong>important text</strong></p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- `html`
  - `body`
    - `h1`
      - *#text:* My Webpage
    - `p`
      - *#text:* This is a paragraph with some
      - `strong`
        - *#text:* important text

---

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>My Webpage</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph with some <strong>important text</strong></p>
    </body>
</html>
```

- **Root**: top-level element
  - `<html />`
- `c` is a **child** of **parent** `p` if it is directly below it
  - `<body />` is a child of `<html />`
  - `<html />` is **the** (singular) parent of `<body />`
- **Sibling** elements have the same parent
  - `h1` and `p` are siblings
- `d` is a **descendant** of **ancestor** `a` if it is below it in the hierarchy (any level)
  - `strong` is a descendant of `html` 
  - `html` is an ancestor of `p`

---

# Attributes

- Elements can have **attributes** that provide additional information about the element
- Attributes are specified in the opening tag
- Attributes have a *name* and a *value*
- The *name* is followed by an equals sign (`=`) and the *value* is surrounded by quotes (`"`)
- For example, the `<a />` element specifies a link, and has an `href` attribute that specifies the URL of the link:

```html
<a href="https://umich.edu/">The University of Michigan Homepage</a>
```

---

# Attributes

- We can have multiple attributes on an element
- For example, the `<img />` element specifies an image, and has `src` and `alt` attributes:

```html
<img src="https://brand.umich.edu/assets/brand/style-guide/logo-guidelines/U-M_Logo-Hex.png" alt="The Block M" />
```
---

# Attributes can omit the value

- Some attributes do not need a value
- For example, the `<button />` element specifies a button, and has a `disabled` attribute:

```html
<button disabled="true">Click Me!</button>
```

...but the browser only cares about the *presence* of the attribute, not its value.

It could be set to `disabled="false"` or `disabled="true"` or `disabled="foo"` and it would still be disabled.

```html
<button disabled>Click Me!</button>
```

---

# Comments

- We can add comments to HTML using the `<!--` and `-->` tags
- Comments are ignored by the browser
- For example:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<!-- <p>This is a commented-out paragraph</p> -->
```

---

# Doctype Declaration

- The first line of an HTML document should be a **doctype declaration**
- This tells the browser what version of HTML we are using
- For example, the following is a doctype declaration for HTML5 (the current version):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
